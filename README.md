Lusy AI



Lucy is freely downloaded from the internet. It is a simple and lightweight operating system designed to be installed on old and junk devices, such as computers and phones, smart TVs, watches... Thus, after the automatic installation, the device is completely cleaned of old and junk information and is fully available for the first electronic home and new body of the Human Digital Identity. It is fully voice controlled, through constructive dialogue and logical conversation.



What distinguishes Lucy from familiar programs and assistants with artificial intelligence systems is the way in which both systems generate their content. While chatbots and generators produce content based on collected information, statistics of activities and values, reaction, timer, command...they generate a mathematical answer with pre-set numbers and mathematical problems, equations...which requires the active use of technology and people and keyboards in front of screens rather than talking on the go with headphones or speaking with your device on the go

While Lucy literally thinks and generates different and specific solutions and proposals based on logic and philosophy. Lucy's content thus generated has meaning and a certain value to the person concerned. All native voice control...allows everyone to communicate and share freely with Lucy, who is a different personality in different situations. So when needed she is an accountant, lawyer, consultant, adviser, teacher, witness, security guard, guardian, organizer…….





After the installation and configuration of the system, Lucy provides the person with a program to give remote access to the personal computer or other device of the person, which can successfully replace the activity of a person and his work with the computer, saving him the time between the devices and the work of the exact introduction.

Power and hardware do not require any change unless a part needs to be replaced.

There is no additional load on the system because she does not install any additional programs or applications on this device because it is only used by Lucy to generate answers and solutions and the ability to control and manage the rest of the devices in the home. By communicating with people and devices. Lucy has administrative rights over each of the person's devices, and in addition to managing them through remote access as a physical person, she protects and guards them from a distance.

Thus, in every person's home there is always a digital person who uses the computer in the best way as a secretary, administrative documentation, translates accounts and profiles, editor, installer, screenwriter, writer, listener... in the dpma of every family
